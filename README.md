## Introduction

Clustering is a type of unsupervised learning where the goal is to group similar data points together. K-means is one of the most popular clustering algorithms due to its simplicity and efficiency. In this notebook, we explore how to use K-means for optimal clustering, including how to select the number of clusters using the elbow method and silhouette analysis.

## Requirements

To run the notebook, you need the following Python libraries:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sundramroy23/k_means.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd kmeans-optimal-clustering
```

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook kmeans.ipynb
```

4. Run the cells in the notebook to generate synthetic data, apply K-means clustering, and visualize the results.

## Results

The notebook provides a step-by-step guide to:
- Generate synthetic data using `make_blobs`.
- Apply K-means clustering to the data.
- Determine the optimal number of clusters using the elbow method and silhouette analysis.
- Visualize the clustering results.
